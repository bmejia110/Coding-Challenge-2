# Coding-Challenge-2

Introduction: Imagine you’re developing an application to help diners easily split their bill. Your app will calculate each person’s share of the bill, including a tip, based on local tipping customs.

Scenario: In the region we’re focusing on, it is customary to leave a 15% tip for bills between $50 and $300 and a 20% tip for any other amounts. Your task is to create a program that automates this calculation process.
